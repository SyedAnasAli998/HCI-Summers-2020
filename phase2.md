## Task Finalization ##
At initial we are going to implement 2 tasks of our application namely **Connectivity** & **Rooms Status** these tasks include the ease for the user in a sense that user can easily connect through their smart devices via bluetooth and WiFi and user can easily see their rooms status that lights are on or off and other appliances also. 

## Need Finding ##
- The current trends in the home automation applications are on **Voice Control** , **Machine learning** & **Fast and smart sensors** 
- Major targated audience which we focused are Family Members, Office Employees becuase this application is not only restricted to home use only but an employee can also use it in their offices also.
- Targated audience are those people who wants to use home appliances in a proper and synchronized manner.

## Design Alternative ##

### Design Alternative 1 ###
- At initial we want a simple static design layout for our application to make user understand each and every option easily adn we thought to have simple color combinations that looks very decent.
  
### Design Alternative 2 ###
- After that we found our first design not that much attractive so we decided to remove static pictures and add slider so that it gives more attraction to the application.
  
### Design Alternative 3 ###
- All of the application options are displayed in form of bar which will be on the center of the screen of the mobile.

### Design Alternative 4 ###
- Since diplaying option in a bar isn't that much attractive and user may not be able to find the options quickly so we decided to show them in forms of cube each option have its own cide in front of the screen and all of the features display in front of the user.
