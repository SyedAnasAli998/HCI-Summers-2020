## Need Finding ##
- All the designs and the thoughts gathered together and now we are heading towards our final design and we are going to implement it in our application.

## Design Alternative ##

### Design Alternative 1 ###
- At initial we want a simple static design layout for our application to make user understand each and every option easily adn we thought to have simple color combinations that looks very decent.
  
### Design Alternative 2 ###
- After that we found our first design not that much attractive so we decided to remove static pictures and add slider so that it gives more attraction to the application.
  
### Design Alternative 3 ###
- All of the application options are displayed in form of bar which will be on the center of the screen of the mobile.

### Design Alternative 4 ###
- Since diplaying option in a bar isn't that much attractive and user may not be able to find the options quickly so we decided to show them in forms of cube each option have its own cide in front of the screen and all of the features display in front of the user.

### Design Alternative 5 ###
- Moving towards all the final phase all the designs are compiled and we evaluated them personally as well as done by our family members.

### Design Alternative 6 ###
- We uses the concept of **Flexiblity** because we don't want our design to be complicated so that user can't find their required option that's why we design a simple and easy designs for our application.
